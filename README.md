# CipherProgram

# Disclaimer:
  The ciphers in this project are not intended to be used to secure information. These are ciphers which are intended to be puzzles to solve (albeit with the assistance of a computer).

Creating "toy" ciphers has been a hobby horse of mine for a couple of years. Originally I wrote a command line program in C++ to encrypt and decrypt text with personal ciphers, however I have since lost that program. This project is an effort to rejuvinate and revise that old project. My hope with this project is that casual cryptology enthusiasts and puzzle solvers can find enjoyment in cracking and analyzing the amatuer ciphers in this program. Lastly, I want to thank my old college roommate Ed for sparking my interest in ciphers.

If you intend to try to solve these ciphers, I encourage you to not look at ciphers.py, as this file contains all the implementation for each cipher. The main file contains no implementation and is safe to look at. If you are running this project through python, run the main file and ensure that auxiliary files are located in the same directory.
